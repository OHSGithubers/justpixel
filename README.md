<hr>

### Author's Story
<p>My internet went out for about 11 hours and I had nothing to do. So I decided to make this game to pass the time.</p>

<hr>

### How To Play
<p>You are controlling the green square</p>
<p>The goal is to get points</p>
<p>You earn points by having an upward velocity while hitting one of the red squares</p>
<p>You also earn points by smashing down on red squares</p>
<p>You smash down on red squares by pressing and releasing the down button</p>
<p>If you hit one of the red squares without an upward velocity, you die</p>
<p>The difficulty grows over time</p>
